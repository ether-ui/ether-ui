## Modern CSS UI Kit

#### EtherUI is in active development! Not meant for production yet!

EtherUI is a modern CSS UI kit which tries to be very simple and lightweight,
yet powerful and extensible. 

The package ships with **no JavaScript** and there are no complicated build steps, 
using EtherUI in your project is incredibly simple,
you could be using it within few seconds!

EtherUI tries to be a common sense compromise between Tailwind's utility classes and Bootstrap's rigidness, bringing you best of both worlds.
